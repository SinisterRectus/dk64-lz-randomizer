![Features](https://github.com/theballaam96/dk64-lz-randomiser/blob/master/image/readme%20-%20features.png)
- Randomization of regular loading zones
	-For example: Trying to enter the loading zone to DK Isles from Aztec Lobby could take you to the Winch Room in Fungi Forest. Exiting the Winch Room however could take you to the Library in Creepy Castle.
	- Some maps are excluded from this randomization (Snide's, Cranky's, Candy's, Funky's, Troff 'n' Scoff, Helm Lobby and Helm Entrance)
- Randomization of Bonus Barrels
	- For Example: Trying to enter the bonus barrel near Arcade in Frantic Factory (Which would take you to Stash Snatch) might take you to Mad Maze Maul
	- This also includes the unused bonus barrels not accessible via normal gameplay!
	- Beaver Bother cannot appear in Hideout Helm (We are nice sometimes)
- Randomized Kasplats
	- Over 110 locations which the 40 kasplats in the game can be
	- All are collectable glitchless as every kong
	- Some are just shifted to [new locations](https://twitter.com/2dosSRL/status/1087442940094500865) and some are [in completely new maps!](https://twitter.com/2dosSRL/status/1087800177765818368)
	- Blueprints stay in the levels you find them in (no blueprint-sanity)
- Randomized bosses
	- The boss you fight in each level is random (the spawned keys are not)
	- The kong used to fight each boss is random
	- The coloured bananas required to open a boss is randomised
	- Exceptions: Chunky must fight Dogadon 2, Lanky cannot fight Mad Jack

![BizHawk Setup Guide](https://github.com/theballaam96/dk64-lz-randomiser/blob/master/image/readme%20-%20setup.png)
- Download and install BizHawk & the pre-requisites
	- Version 1.12.1 is recommended for DK64 due to it's inclusion of the Dynarec Core Type & Jabo's Video Plugin (and also the best version for reducing BizHawk crashes)
	- To alter your plugins/settings, open any N64 ROM, click N64 (Top bar), and then click plugins.
	- What settings you change depends on your PC's performance.
	
- High Performance settings
	- Core Type: Dynarec
		- Other core types have bugs with chunks not appearing visually
	- Rsp Plugin: Hle
	- Active Video Plugin: Jabo 1.6.1
		- This will cause some issues with objects and transparency (eg. Golden Bananas, Coloured Bananas, Warp Pads), however these are just visual
		- However, this is good for low-performance PCs
	- Video Resolution: 320x240
	
- Aesthetic Settings
	- Core Type: Dynarec
	- Rsp Plugin: Hle
	- Active Video Plugin: GlideN64
		- If you get some graphical glitching (parts of kong textures appearing way too bright, reboot the core (Ctrl + R) to fix
		- This will act as a console reset, so don't reboot core if your progress
	- Video Resolution: 800x600
		- This is a decent compromise between good visual quality and good performance
		- If your PC can handle it, feel free to increase
		
- Controller Mapping
	- Go to Config > Controllers
	- All button mappings: Use the first page (Player 1, Normal Controls)
	- Analogue Stick mapping: Use the 3rd page (Player 1, Analog Controls)
		- This allows you to go in all directions, not just the 8 ordinal/cardinal points.

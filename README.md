![Features](https://github.com/theballaam96/dk64-lz-randomizer/blob/master/image/readme%20-%20features.png)
- Randomization of regular loading zones
	-For example: Trying to enter the loading zone to DK Isles from Aztec Lobby could take you to the Winch Room in Fungi Forest. Exiting the Winch Room however could take you to the Library in Creepy Castle.
	- Some maps are excluded from this randomization (Snide's, Cranky's, Candy's, Funky's, Troff 'n' Scoff, Helm Lobby and Helm Entrance)
- Randomization of Bonus Barrels
	- For Example: Trying to enter the bonus barrel near Arcade in Frantic Factory (Which would take you to Stash Snatch) might take you to Mad Maze Maul
	- This also includes the unused bonus barrels not accessible via normal gameplay!
	- Beaver Bother, the two harder Minecart Mayhems, and a couple unused minigames cannot appear in Hideout Helm (We are nice sometimes)
- Randomized Kasplats
	- Over 100 locations which the 40 kasplats in the game can be
	- All are collectable glitchless as every kong
	- Some are just shifted to [new locations](https://twitter.com/2dosSRL/status/1087442940094500865) and some are [in completely new maps!](https://twitter.com/2dosSRL/status/1087800177765818368)
	- Blueprints stay in the levels you find them in (no blueprint-sanity)
		- One exception, the Kasplat in Kut Out will belong to Castle regardless of what level Kut Out appears in
- Randomized bosses
	- The boss you fight in each level is random (the spawned keys are not)
	- The kong used to fight each boss is random
	- The coloured bananas required to open a boss is randomised
		- The counts cannot go above a certain cap that's determined on a level-by-level basis
	- Exceptions: Chunky must fight Dogadon 2, Lanky cannot fight Mad Jack, Tiny can't fight Army Dillo II, DK can't fight pufftoss

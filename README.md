# Donkey Kong 64 Loading Zone Randomizer
A loading zone randomizer lua script for Donkey Kong 64.
Intended for BizHawk.

## Installation and usage
- Step 1: Open the [BizHawk emulator](https://github.com/TASVideos/BizHawk/releases/)
- Step 2: Open any valid DK64 ROM (The 'Not For Resale' version of this game is not supported)
- Step 3: Open the Lua Console (Tools > Lua Console)
- Step 4: Open the Loading Zone Randomiser (Script > Open Script > lzr.lua)
- Step 5: Select the settings you want to use and determine your seed
- Step 6: Click confirm and enjoy the oncoming madness!

## Features
- Randomisation of regular loading zones
	- For example: Trying to enter the loading zone to DK Isles from Aztec Lobby will take you to the Winch Room in Fungi Forest (Seed #801).
	- Some maps are excluded from this randomisation (Snide's, Cranky's, Candy's, Funky's, Troff 'n' Scoff)
- Randomisation of Bonus Barrels
	- For Example: Trying to enter the bonus barrel near Arcade in Frantic Factory (Which would take you to Stash Snatch) might take you to Mad Maze Maul
	- This also includes the unused bonus barrels
- Cutscenes are reduced
	- You will be taken to the main menu right after the Nintendo Logo, skipping the DK Rap, Rareware & N64 Logo and DK TV
	- Snide's contraption cutscenes are reduced to just the initial pulley cutscene
- Option to acquire all moves in the game from the start
	- Cuts out some coin collection, completely optional

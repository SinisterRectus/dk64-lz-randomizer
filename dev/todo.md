	Accessibility Rules done:
	-Ensure all tag-less maps can be reached by the right kong starting from map with tag
	-Ensure all maps with tag barrels can be reached from the start
	-Consider which Maps/LZs are "origins" of a given LZ
		(ex: Origins of Factory Car Race are Factory(entering race) and Factory Car Race(restarting))
	-Consider LZs that can only be entered by certain kongs
	-Consider LZs that can be entered by some kongs, but another kong opens them
	-Consider LZs that can only be entered when another map has been reached (other than its natural origin)
	-Consider which kongs are free from the start and when they can be freed organically
	
	Accessibility Rules to work on:
	-Consider which moves are given from the start and when they can be obtained
	-Consider which keys have been turned in (for isles lz access)
	-Consider how many bananas are obtainable in relation to the level's T&S amount
